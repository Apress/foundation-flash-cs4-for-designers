Let's admit it: If we enter text, we will inevitbly use the wrong spelling for a word or two. Flash CS4 contains a spell-checking tool that checks the spelling of all of the text in a document. You don’t have heartless editors peering over your shoulders like we do, so spell checking your work before sending it to the Web is a really good idea. It should therefore not come as too much of a surprise to discover the spell-checking feature of Flash is quite robust. It allows you to check not only the spelling of the text in your text fields, but also the spelling in your layer names.
